  <p><center>I offer a complete garden service in Nottingham and the surrounding areas.

My services include lawn cutting and maintenance, weeding and weed prevention, hedge cutting and pruning, planting and maintenance of borders, hanging baskets and planters.

I have over 40 years of experience, I'm DBS checked, affordably priced, reliable and punctual.

If you happen to have an allotment or you're thinking of acquiring one, I can help there too. I've had an allotment for over 40 years which you can see in the gallery section of the website. Within the gallery you'll also see photos of the gardens I have worked on previously.

Gardening is a passion of mine and I treat each customers garden as if it was my own, always aiming for perfection.</p>
